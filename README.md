This is a simple, automated Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Multiple bots with different strategies play against each other in a series of matches.

There’s no user input—just run the code, and watch the bots go!

Each bot follows a specific pattern (random, repeating, copying, etc.), and results are tracked to see which strategy performs best in a tournament-style simulation.

This was originally developed as part of a university assessment.
